# This is what you've to do after you come back from the Break:
* Using a for loop, store the info of files in a variable and assign all of those variables
* Make the working of Removing Files actually "WORK"!


# Try to Succeed! You have to do it and I know you can do It! (Eventhough I am You and You are me meaning we're the same person !)

# Good We have completed showing the buttons
# Now we will start working for modifications of the files using the os module, for the frontend we will be adding tools to the left side of the buttons to make the job done!
