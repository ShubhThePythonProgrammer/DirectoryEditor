# This is what you've to do after you come back from the Exams:
* Using a for loop, store the info of files in a variable and assign all of those variables
* Make the working of Removing Files actually "WORK"!
* Using the os module, list out all the files on the computer to switch

# Try to Succeed! You have to do it and I know you can do It! (Eventhough I am You and You are me meaning we're the same person GODDAMMIT!)
